# tiki

`tiki` is a simple and lightweight way to keep your tasks, prompts, documents, ideas, scratchpads in your project **git** repo

![Intro](assets/intro.png)

[Documentation](.doc/doki/doc/index.md)

Markdown is the new go-to format for everything, it's simple, efficient, human and AI native - project management, 
documentation, brainstorming ideas, incomplete implementations, AI prompts and plans and what not are saved as Markdown files. 
Stick them in your repo. Keep around for as long as you need. Find them back in **git** history. Make issues out of them
and take them through an agile lifecycle. `tiki` helps you save and organize these files:

- Standalone **Markdown viewer** - view and edit Markdown files, navigate to local/external/GitHub/GitLab links, edit and save
- Keep, search, view and version Markdown files in the **git repo**
- **Wiki-style** documentation with multiple entry points
- Keep a **to-do list** with priorities, status, assignee and size
- Issue management with **Kanban/Scrum** style board and burndown chart
- **Plugin-first** architecture - user-defined plugins with filters and actions like Backlog, Recent, Roadmap
- AI **skills** to enable [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com), [Codex](https://openai.com/codex), [Opencode](https://opencode.ai) work with natural language commands like
  "_create a tiki from @my-file.md_"
  "_mark tiki ABC123 as complete_"

## tiki
Keep your tickets in your pockets!

`tiki` refers to a task or a ticket (hence tiki) stored in your **git** repo

- like a ticket it can have a status, priority, assignee, points, type and multiple tags attached to it
- they are essentially just Markdown files and you can use full Markdown syntax to describe a story or a bug
- they are stored in `.doc/tiki` subdirectory and are **git**-controlled - they are added to **git** when they are created,
removed when they are done and the entire history is preserved in **git** repo
- because they are in **git** they can be perfectly synced up to the state of your repo or a branch
- you can use either the `tiki` CLI tool or any of the AI coding assistant to work with your tikis

## doki
Store your notes in remotes!

`doki` refers to any file in Markdown format that is stored in the `.doc/doki` subdirectory of the **git** repo. 

- like tikis they are **git**-controlled and can be maintained in perfect sync with the repo state
- `tiki` CLI tool allows creating multiple doc roots like: Documentation, Brainstorming, Prompts etc.
- it also allows viewing and navigation (follow links)

## tiki TUI tool

`tiki` TUI tool allows creating, viewing, editing and deleting tikis as well as creating custom plugins to 
view any selection, for example, Recent tikis, Architecture docs, Saved prompts, Security review, Future Roadmap

- create, find, modify and delete tikis using AI
- create tikis/dokis directly from Markdown files
- Refer to tikis or dokis when implementing with AI-assisted development - `implement tiki xxxxxxx`
