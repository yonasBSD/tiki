# tiki
Keep your tickets in your pockets!

`tiki` refers to a task or a ticket (hence tiki) stored in your **git** repo

- like a ticket it can have a status, priority, assignee, points, type and multiple tags attached to it
- they are essentially just Markdown files and you can use full Markdown syntax to describe a story or a bug
- they are stored in `.doc/tiki` subdirectory and are **git**-controlled - they are added to **git** when they are created,
  removed when they are done and the entire history is preserved in **git** repo
- because they are in **git** they can be perfectly synced up to the state of your repo or a branch
- you can use either the `tiki` CLI tool or any of the AI coding assistant to work with your tikis

# doki
Store your notes in remotes!

`doki` refers to any file in Markdown format that is stored in the `.doc/doki` subdirectory of the **git** repo.

- like tikis they are **git**-controlled and can be maintained in perfect sync with the repo state
- `tiki` CLI tool allows creating multiple doc roots like: Documentation, Brainstorming, Prompts etc.
- it also allows viewing and navigation (follow links)

# tiki TUI tool
